# project_a3r8j_o3s5g_z5y8p

Database project for CPSC 304.

Description:

Our project is to present core information about items in the game “Book of Hours”. This project acts as a centralized place where players can quickly look up data while playing the game. Since the game provides no tutorial to the player and most of the game mechanics are discovered through trial and error, we design this wikipedia for the player to look up the information quickly.

Instruction for connecting to the server:

1. From root, open terminal and run `cd backend`.
2. If not already, add an `.env` file with the server credentials in the same folder (credentials are in groupchat).
3. On terminal, run `npm install` and then `node server.js`.

Make sure to frequenly check `./project_info/Milestone 3 Timeline.md` to see which tasks need to be done

The demo project will demonstrate book and memory tables
